Having the rice cold is key—it keeps the texture perfect!\n2. **Scramble:** Heat the oil in a small skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Pour in the eggs and scramble quickly, breaking them into small pieces. Cook until they are just set (about 1 minute). Scoop the cooked egg out and set it aside on a plate.\n3. **Heat the Rice:** Add the cold rice to the same pan. Use your spatula to break up any clumps. Cook the rice for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it is thoroughly heated and slightly crisp.\n4. **Combine and Finish:** Return the scrambled eggs to the pan with the rice. Add the soy sauce immediately. Toss everything together vigorously for about 30 seconds until the rice is evenly coated and steaming hot.\n5. **Serve:** Taste and add a splash more soy sauce if needed. Serve your incredibly quick, satisfying dinner!\n\n### **Chef Remy's Money-Saving Tip:**\n\n*   Cold, leftover rice is not just acceptable—it is mandatory for great fried rice! Using day-old rice prevents the dish from getting mushy, ensuring you don't waste any grains and giving you a restaurant-quality texture without extra effort.", 'filename': 'Quick Egg Fried Rice'} | STATUS: ✅ | RESULT: Recipe saved successfully to `Quick_Egg_Fried_Rice.md`
