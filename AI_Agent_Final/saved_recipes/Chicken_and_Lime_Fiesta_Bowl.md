## **Recipe Name: Chicken and Lime Fiesta Bowl**

* **Servings:** 4
* **Budget:** Low
* **Effort:** Easy
* **Total Time:** 45 minutes

### **Ingredients:**

* Chicken breast or thighs, 1 pound (cut into 1-inch cubes)
* White or brown rice, 1 cup (dry)
* Black beans, 1 (15 oz) can (drained and rinsed)
* Red bell pepper, 1 large (diced)
* Mushrooms, 8 ounces (sliced)
* Yellow onion, 1 medium (diced)
* Garlic, 3 cloves (minced)
* Fresh cilantro, 1/2 cup (chopped, plus more for garnish)
* Lime, 2 fresh limes
* Olive oil, 2 tablespoons
* Cumin, 1 teaspoon
* Salt and black pepper, to taste

### **Instructions (Remy's Simple Steps):**

1.  **Start the Rice:** Cook your cup of rice according to package directions. This usually takes about 15-20 minutes, which is perfect timing for the rest of the meal!
2.  **Sauté the Aromatics:** Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the diced onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the vegetables start to soften. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
3.  **Cook the Chicken:** Push the vegetables to one side of the pan. Add the cubed chicken to the empty side. Season the chicken generously with salt, pepper, and the teaspoon of cumin. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is browned and cooked through (about 6-8 minutes).
4.  **Combine the Fiesta:** Reduce the heat to low. Stir the cooked chicken and vegetables together. Add the drained black beans and the juice of one full lime. Stir well to coat everything in the lime juice and seasoning. Cook for 2-3 minutes to heat the beans through.
5.  **Assemble and Finish:** Once the rice is finished, fluff it with a fork. Divide the rice among your serving bowls. Spoon the chicken and bean mixture over the rice. Garnish each bowl generously with the fresh chopped cilantro and serve with lime wedges from the remaining lime for extra zing!

### **Chef Remy's Money-Saving Tip:**

* Buying rice and dried beans in bulk is a huge saver! Dried beans may require soaking, but they are often a fraction of the cost of canned beans and taste even fresher.
